**Research Experience**
---------------------

* **ReTalk Agent: Multilingual Video Dubbing**, 2025.8 – 2025.10.
  * Developed an AI agent pipeline that transforms input videos into multilingual versions by leveraging LLM-based language processing while preserving the speaker's unique voice identity.
  * Implemented lip-synchronization and voice cloning techniques to ensure natural alignment of facial movements with translated speech, producing high-quality, culturally adaptive video outputs.

* **LLM-Powered Voice Assistant with Voice Cloning**, 2025.6 – 2025.8.
  * Designed and implemented an interactive voice assistant leveraging large language models (LLMs) as the core reasoning engine, enabling natural, context-aware conversations with users.
  * Integrated voice cloning technology to generate a personalized synthetic voice, allowing seamless spoken interaction and enhancing user engagement in real-time dialogue.

* **Valuing Solo and Synergy in Federated Learning**, 2024.10 – 2025.7.
  * Proposed DuoShapley, an efficient Shapley value approximation that adaptively balances individual (Solo) and collaborative (Leave-One-Out) user contributions to improve valuation efficiency across heterogeneous federated learning settings.
  * Demonstrated that DuoShapley achieves over 200× speedup and higher robustness with noisy users, enabling scalable and reliable client selection for large-scale federated learning.

* **Maverick-Aware Shapley Valuation for Client Selection in FL**, 2023.10 – 2024.9.
  * Designed a Maverick-aware Shapley valuation framework to quantify client contributions under data heterogeneity, addressing undervaluation of clients with rare or underrepresented classes.
  * Developed FedMS, a Shapley-guided client selection mechanism that adaptively prioritizes high-value clients, improving global performance and robustness against adversaries and free-riders.

* **PriPrune: Quantifying and Preserving Privacy in Pruned FL**, 2022.11 - 2023.8.
  * Conducted research on privacy guarantees for model pruning in FL, deriving information-theoretic upper bounds on information leakage in pruned models.
  * Developed PriPrune – a privacy-aware pruning algorithm with personalized, per-client defense masks and adaptive pruning rates, balancing privacy and model performance.

* **Information Leakage in Personalized Federated Learning**, 2022.4 – 2022.6.
  * Executed the gradient leakage attack (DLG) in personalized FL, demonstrating how personalization levels impact vulnerability.
  * Proposed PerFed-LDP, a per-example differential privacy method for personalized FL, analyzing privacy-utility tradeoff under DP settings.

* **Privacy by Projection: Federated Population Density Estimation**, 2021.12 – 2022.7.
  * Designed a federated kernel density estimation (KDE) framework to estimate population density while ensuring data remains local.
  * Developed a federated Random Fourier Feature (RFF) KDE approach projecting user info onto spatially delocalized basis functions, enhancing privacy without hurting accuracy.

* **Location Leakage in Federated Signal Maps**, 2021.11 – 2022.4.
  * Executed gradient leakage attacks on federated signal map prediction, reconstructing average locations from private spatio-temporal datasets.
  * Proposed batch selection defenses to obfuscate true location, balancing utility in mapping with privacy protection.

* **SaferQ: Obfuscating Search Queries via Generative Adversarial Privacy**, 2020.3 – 2020.5.
  * Developed SaferQ, extending the GAP framework for sequence generation to obfuscate search queries while balancing privacy and utility.

* **Secure Federated XGBoost Framework**, 2018.9 – 2019.8.
  * Designed a secure federated XGBoost framework incorporating anonymized data aggregation to balance privacy and performance.
